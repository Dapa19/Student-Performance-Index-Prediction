# Student Performance Index Prediction System
## Project Overview
This project is a Multiple Linear Regression-based system designed to predict a student's performance index based on various academic and lifestyle factors. The system is built using Python, with a simple web interface to input the necessary data and visualize the prediction results.

# Features
- Input academic and lifestyle data such as hours studied, previous scores, participation in extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and the number of sample question papers practiced.
- Predict the student's performance index based on the input data.
- Display the prediction results in a clear and easy-to-understand format.
- Simple and user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.

# Technologies Used
- Python: For building the machine learning model (Multiple Linear Regression).
- Flask: For developing the web application.
- HTML/CSS & Bootstrap: For creating the user interface.
- Jupyter Notebook: For data exploration and model training.
- Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: For building the Multiple Linear Regression model.

# Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset containing several predictor variables, such as the number of hours a student studies, previous scores, participation in extracurricular activities, hours of sleep per day, and the number of sample question papers practiced.
